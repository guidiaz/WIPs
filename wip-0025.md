## Abstract

Establishes how nodes are expected to handle HTTP redirects when performing data retrieval in the Witnet protocol.

## Motivation and rationale

The most popular feature of the Witnet protocol is the ability to perform retrieval of information from several data
sources over the HTTP protocol in such a way that trust on specific data providers can be mitigated.

In the HTTP protocol, there are many reasons why a request can fail to complete. These include malformed requests,
server errors, client errors, network disruptions, etc. Most of those errors are identified by their own HTTP
response status codes.

One particular case of response status codes are _redirection messages_, because they are not errors per se. When an
HTTP client receives a redirection message, the client is expected to resend its request to a different host as
specified by the received message.

It is customary for HTTP clients such as web browsers to follow redirects a limited number of times. That is, to obey
the redirection messages that they receive, up to a certain limit of times. This limit exists to prevent potential
abuse or attacks.

Current implementations of the Witnet protocol do not follow redirects. They rather handle redirection messages
indistinctly to HTTP error messages.

The lack of support for HTTP redirects precludes the usage of many HTTP data sources such as public APIs that may
respond with redirection messages consistently or inconsistently (e.g. "temporary redirects") as part of their normal
operation.

This document introduces a set of ecosystem-wide rules on how to handle HTTP redirects, thus widening the choice of
data sources that can be used in Witnet oracle queries. It also establishes a limit of 4 redirects per retrieval, which
is believed to be enough to support most public APIs, while preventing potential abuse or attacks.

## Specification

### Handling of redirects messages

**(1)** Redirect messages with HTTP response status codes `301`, `302`, `303`, `307`, `308` MUST be honored just as
expected for an HTTP client, by resending the request to the address specified in the `Location` header of the
redirect message.

**(2)** Redirect messages with other HTTP response status codes, or not containing the `Location` header, MUST be
handled as an `HttpOther` error.

### Limit on redirects

**(3)** For each original HTTP request, only 4 redirects are allowed.

**(4)** If the 4-redirects limit is reached, a 5th redirect MUST be handled as an `HttpOther` error.

## Backwards compatibility

- Implementer: a client that implements or adopts the protocol improvements proposed in this document.
- Non-implementer: a client that fails to or refuses to implement the protocol improvements proposed in this document.


#### Consensus cheat sheet

Upon entry into force of the proposed improvements:

- Blocks and transactions considered valid by former versions of the protocol MUST continue to be considered valid.
- Blocks and transactions produced by non-implementers MUST be validated by implementers using the same rules as with
those coming from implementers, that is, the new rules.
- Implementers MUST apply the proposed logic when resolving oracle queries.

As a result:

- Commitments and reveals signed by non-implementers MAY differ from those signed by implementers.
- Oracle queries MAY resolve to `InsufficientConsensus` given a witnessing committee formed by a mixed sample of
implementers and non-implementers.

Due to these last points, this MUST be considered a consensus-critical protocol improvement. An adoption plan MUST be
proposed, setting an activation date that gives miners enough time in advance to upgrade their existing clients.


### Libraries, clients, and interfaces

The protocol improvements proposed herein will affect any library or client implementing any functionality related to
the retrieval part of the RAD engine.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation for the proposed protocol improvement can be found in the
[pull request #2308](https://github.com/witnet/witnet-rust/pull/2308) of the [witnet-rust] repository.

## Adoption Plan

An activation date is proposed for March 7 2023 at 9am UTC, that is, protocol epoch `#1678160`.

From the perspective of TAPI, the signaling bit is `6` (`0b00000000000000000000000010000000`) and the
`first_signaling_epoch` is set to `#1651280` (February 21 at 9am UTC).

## Acknowledgements

This proposal has been cooperatively discussed and devised by many individuals from the Witnet development community.
